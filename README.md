- **Hybrid Tickets**: Combination of different generation methods
- **Historical Performance**: See how generated numbers would have performed

### üíæ **Personal Number Management**
- **Save Number Sets**: Store your favorite combinations with custom names
- **Historical Analysis**: Check how your numbers performed in past draws
- **Bulk Analysis**: Analyse all saved number sets simultaneously

### üîç **Advanced Features**
- **Bias Detection**: Statistical analysis for lottery equipment anomalies
- **Winner Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of historical winning combinations
- **Seasonal Effects**: Time-based pattern detection
- **Physical Equipment Analysis**: Ball wear and machine bias detection

### üåê **Data Management**
- **Live Data**: Downloads latest results from official EuroMillions API
